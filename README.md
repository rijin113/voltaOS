# voltaOS⚙️

## Description
A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) programmed on the STM32F411 microcontroller. It has a monolithic kernel and it uses EDF scheduling to meet real-time deadlines in the OS. Moreover, to see how the OS supports multithreading, there are test cases present in the code that show pre-emptive and co-operative multitasking.

## Next Steps
- Utilize a more efficient data structure for the thread control blocks
- Implement Mutual Exclusion
